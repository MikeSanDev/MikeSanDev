<!-- About Section --> 
<h3 align="center"> 🕺🏽 About Me: </h3>

I am a full stack developer with a passion for creating fully functional websites and applications and a background in Dentistry.

I pursued a career in software development to tap into my creativity and continuously grow my skills. To further my knowledge, I completed a coding bootcamp at Coding Dojo and have since worked on a number of full-stack projects. One of my proudest collaborations was with Kinetic Footwear, a cutting-edge startup that leverages the kinetic energy generated by walking to power a battery pack built into the sole of their sneakers.

In my free time, I enjoy staying active through various physical activities such as lifting weights, running, and dancing. I am a Hip Hop freestyle dancer and regularly train with my crew, competing in dance battles across Chicago.
